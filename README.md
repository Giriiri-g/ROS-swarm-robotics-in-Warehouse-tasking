This project aims to develop a swarm robotics system capable of moving goods efficiently within a constrained warehouse environment. Multi-Agent Path Finding and sophisticated 
conflict resolution Algorithms are used. The conflict resolution algorithm is inspired by Docking Point Strategy, Reservation Based Parking and Conflict Based Search. 
These algorithms helps to overcome challenges in coordinating multiple robots in real-time to avoid traffic congestion and optimize route efficiency. The prototype simulates a warehouse
with robots performing pickup and drop-off tasks in a structured yet restricted space. The prototype will consist of a scaled-down warehouse environment featuring three pickup depots and 
three drop-off depots. Robots will be tasked with navigating narrow aisles to move goods from pickup to drop-off points, demonstrating efficient pathfinding and traffic avoidance in real time.
